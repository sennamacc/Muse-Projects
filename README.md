# Muse-Projects
This repository contains projects that I made using python to perform actions correlated to data streamed from the Muse 2 headband.
# Muse 2 Eyeblink Detection Tab Project.py
This project uses thresholds to understand when the user blinks. When you blink, it switches tab.
# Concentration Detection and Music Playing.py
This project measures the users beta-to-theta brainwave ratio to detect concentration levels. When the user is conentrated, music plays, when they get distracted, the music pauses.
# utils.py
Utils is a library that I used in both of the above project and will need to be downloaded to run my code.
